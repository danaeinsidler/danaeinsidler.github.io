	<h3>Dogs Have Better Noses</h3>
		
		<p>Dogs can discriminate odors at concentrations nearly 100 million times lower than 	humans can. The wet nose is essential for determining the direction of the air current 	containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by 	evaporation of the moisture by air currents.</p>

	<h3>Cats Have Better Tongues</h3>
		<p>Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking their coats. The 	cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 micrometers long, which are called papillae. 	These are quite rigid, as they contain keratin. These spines allow cats to groom themselves by 	licking their fur, with the rows of papillae acting like a hairbrush.</p>
